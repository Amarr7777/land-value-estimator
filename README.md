# Land Value Estimator

## Predictive Model for Land Price Discrepancies

**Team Name:** HackHive

**Team Members:** 
- Aaron Joju
- Amar G Nath
- Vishnu Swaroop P S

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to bridge the gap between government-provided base values for land prices and actual selling prices. Despite official valuations, significant disparities exist in real-world transactions, influenced by various factors including village demographics, land type, district attributes, and state-level influences.

Our solution leverages machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to estimate selling prices accurately, providing valuable insights into regional variations in pricing discrepancies and their underlying drivers.

## Objectives

- Develop a robust predictive model to estimate land selling prices accurately.
- Bridge the gap between government-provided base values and actual selling prices.
- Provide insights into regional variations in pricing discrepancies.
- Deploy a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Key Features

1. Comprehensive data collection and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and engineering to identify relevant predictors
3. Advanced machine learning algorithms for accurate price estimation
4. Regional analysis and interpretation of pricing factors
5. User-friendly interface for easy access to predictions

## Benefits

- Accurate predictions enable informed decision-making in real estate transactions.
- Promotes transparency and efficiency in the land market.
- Helps optimize land utilization and promotes equitable development.
- Empowers stakeholders including investors, government officials, and land buyers/sellers.
